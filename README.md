# RTL-Design-and-Synthesis-of-LSTM-unit-cell
Designed and implemented a hardware-efficient LSTM unit in Verilog with approximated sigmoid and tanh activations, enabling real-time inference acceleration on FPGAs. Developed modular components including gate computations, state updates, and a testbench for functional verification.
